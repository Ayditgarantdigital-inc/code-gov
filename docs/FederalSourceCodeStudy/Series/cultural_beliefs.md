By [Joseph Castle](https://digital.gov/authors/joseph-castle/), PhD, and the Code.gov Team

*This write-up summarizes portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.

As summarized in [Part 1](https://medium.com/codedotgov/federal-source-code-study-series-part-1-the-overview-72acce742260) of this series, the study explored four organizational factors of believed to be hindering or aiding agency publication of OSS. The organizational factors were cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimensions, and organizational location and each will be explored in an upcoming series post. We begin here with cultural beliefs.

There is a lot of academic and industry research on culture and its various components. This study briefly defined organizational culture and how cultural beliefs may have impacted federal agency ability to publish OSS.

## Culture

There are numerous definitions and elements of culture. Culture was originally rooted in anthropological and sociological studies with a focus on relationships among small groups and tribes through the study of behaviors and norms. It was considered to be relatively stable and homogeneous. Organizational culture provided a view of social arrangements and outcomes in workplaces, which enabled managers to exercise control and ensure success. Culture is often considered as a monolithic phenomenon or one culture to a setting. However, organizational units tend to exhibit subcultures, not necessarily in conflict with the parent culture, but supporting their own norms and behaviors.

## Beliefs

Beliefs are a key component of organizational culture and support organizational performance. Beliefs support organizations in making predictions, selecting actions, and play an important role in understanding what was observed and enacted in particular situations. Beliefs can be used for making predictions and selecting actions and they could play an important role in understanding what is observed and enacted when confronted a particular situation. Beliefs are acquired through experience by explanations and consequences supporting or negating a belief. Finally, beliefs are continually and collectively validated as groups tested and solved problems.

## Findings

Recall for this Series [Part 1](https://medium.com/codedotgov/federal-source-code-study-series-part-1-the-overview-72acce742260), there were 25 participants from software development units in 20 CFO Act agencies. Some agencies had multiple participants, but no participant was from the same SW development unit.

The interview guide consisted of the following questions or statements pertaining to cultural beliefs.
1. What are your unit's beliefs on consuming open source software (OSS)?
2. Based on public data, your agency publishes code minimally, intermediately, or frequently. Does your unit publish code, and if so, does your unit believe this is the appropriate amount?
3. Based on response to the previous question, provide why the unit believes this is or is not the appropriate amount.
4. Does your unit use a public coding platform with open repositories?
5. Describe your unit's goals with regards to software development (e.g., collaborate, deliver product).


## Coming Up

The next part of this series focuses on the organizational factor of public engagement and how it affected OSS publication.

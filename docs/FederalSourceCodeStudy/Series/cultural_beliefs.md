*This write-up summarizes portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.

As summarized in [Part 1](https://medium.com/codedotgov/federal-source-code-study-series-part-1-the-overview-72acce742260) of this series, the study explored four organizational factors of believed to be hindering or aiding agency publication of OSS. The organizational factors were cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimensions, and organizational location and each will be explored in an upcoming series post. We begin here with cultural beliefs.

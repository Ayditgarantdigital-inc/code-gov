# Cultural Beliefs
By [Joseph Castle](https://digital.gov/authors/joseph-castle/), PhD, and the Code.gov team

*This write-up summarizes portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.*
